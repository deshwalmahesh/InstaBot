
It is a Python's library Selenium based tool to automate the functioning of Online Website Instagram. It can auomate the working of Instagram such as liking a picture, following, unfollowing of a specific user and connect to the type of audience 
given by just one account whom you think is a famous page in the field of your choice. For the current time, Only liking of random images of public users and following of private users has been done. Unfollow, Commenting is given in old code. 

It is a bit slow but barely detected by BOT catcher tools by Instagram because a lot of randomness is included in this code.

I hope, I'll be Implementing it as a class based structure after some time.
